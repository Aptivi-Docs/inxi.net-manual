# üåç Network

This lists information about the network cards that are parsed by Inxi. You can use the below properties to learn more about its information.

Module name according to each operating system:

| OS      | Module name            |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Linux   | `006#Network`          |
| Windows | `Win32_NetworkAdapter` |
| macOS   | `SPNetworkDataType`    |

You can call the module either by enumerating through the entire dictionary of the network cards, or you can use the card name directly as follows:

```csharp
HardwareInfo.Network["Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller"].<property>
```

which `<property>` is:

| Property      | Type   | Description         |
