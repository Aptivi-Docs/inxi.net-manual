## Installation

This library is very easy to install. It's available at [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Inxi.NET/). Just follow these steps:

1. Open your project file (`.csproj` or `.fsproj`)
2. Place the `PackageReference` line on a property group like so:
   * `<PackageReference Include="Inxi.NET" Version="x.x.x" />`
   * ...where `Version` is the current version of the library
3. Run a package restore using `dotnet restore`

If you follow these steps correctly, you should be able to use Inxi.NET's functions.
